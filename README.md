# CraneGuy Sling App

Geometry-based sling angle and rigging tension calculator built for real jobsite use.

## Purpose
Provide calculation-correct sling angles, leg tensions, and governing-condition identification using true lift geometry — not rules of thumb.

## Scope
- Multi-leg sling configurations
- Governing-leg determination
- Minimum required and recommended rigging sizing
- Hook height and clearance checks
- Rigging and hardware weight accounting

This tool is intended for field validation and training support.

## Governing Logic
All outputs are limited by the controlling sling leg, angle, hardware capacity, geometry, or clearance — whichever governs first.

## Field Principles
- Geometry is authoritative
- Load-sharing is allowed where applicable
- All distances are rounded up to the nearest whole foot for user-facing outputs
- Safety gates block invalid configurations

## Status
Active development — field-use logic frozen per master specification.

## Disclaimer
Load acceptability and lug integrity are the user’s responsibility.
