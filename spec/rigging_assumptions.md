SLING CONDITION & TAG REQUIREMENT

All sling working load limits (WLL) provided by the Sling App are reference values only.

If a sling’s work load limit tag is missing, illegible, or incomplete, that sling shall not be used.

Published sling WLL values apply only to slings that are new, undamaged, properly stored, and inspected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

The Sling App does not and cannot verify sling condition, inspection status, or tag accuracy.
Load acceptability and sling condition remain the user’s responsibility.
