# Security & Safety Disclosure Policy — CraneGuyLabs Sling App

This policy applies **only** to the CraneGuyLabs Sling App.

The Sling App is a **below-the-hook rigging calculator**.  
All rigging is assumed to occur **at the hook and below**.  
Crane selection, crane capacity, crane setup, and crane operation are **out of scope** unless explicitly stated elsewhere.

If you discover a security vulnerability, calculation error, or logic flaw that could affect **rigging safety or load-handling decisions**, please report it responsibly.

Errors in rigging calculations or logic can result in serious injury, equipment damage, or loss of life.

## What Should Be Reported

Report any issue that could cause unsafe or incorrect **below-the-hook rigging decisions**, including but not limited to:

- Incorrect sling angle, sling tension, or load distribution calculations  
- Errors in pick-point geometry, elevation reference, or sling-length logic  
- Rigging selection outputs that could result in unsafe configurations  
- Hardware sizing, rating, or compatibility errors  
- Logic flaws that bypass safety limits, warnings, or validation gates  
- Data corruption, manipulation, or injection risks affecting calculations  
- Any defect that could reasonably lead to an unsafe rigging outcome

## Responsible Reporting

Please report safety-critical issues **privately**.

**Email:** security@craneguy.app

When possible, include:
- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected versus actual behavior  
- Input values, screenshots, or sample data

## Disclosure Rules

- **Do not open public GitHub issues** for safety-critical findings  
- **Do not publicly disclose** vulnerabilities prior to review and resolution  
- Public GitHub issues may be used **only** for non-safety-critical defects

## Safe Harbor

CraneGuyLabs supports responsible disclosure.

Researchers, professionals, and users acting in good faith to identify and report issues that may affect rigging safety will not be penalized when reporting through the proper channel.

## Response Commitment

All reports are reviewed in good faith and prioritized based on potential **rigging safety impact**.
