# Security & Safety Disclosure Policy — Sling App

This policy applies **only** to the Sling App.

The Sling App is a **below-the-hook rigging calculator**.  
All rigging is assumed to occur **at the hook and below**.  
Crane selection, crane capacity, crane setup, and crane operation are **out of scope** unless explicitly stated elsewhere.

If you discover a security vulnerability, calculation error, or logic flaw that could affect **rigging safety or load-handling decisions**, please report it responsibly.

Errors in rigging calculations or logic can result in serious injury, equipment damage, or loss of life.

---

## What Should Be Reported

Report any issue that could cause unsafe or incorrect **below-the-hook rigging decisions**, including but not limited to:

- Incorrect sling angle, tension, or load distribution calculations  
- Errors in pick-point geometry or sling-length logic  
- Rigging selection outputs that could be unsafe  
- Hardware sizing or compatibility errors  
- Logic flaws that bypass safety limits, warnings, or validation gates  
- Data corruption, manipulation, or injection risks  
- Any defect that could reasonably lead to an unsafe rigging configuration

---

## Responsible Reporting

Please report safety-critical issues **privately**.

**Email:** security@craneguy.app

Include when possible:
- Clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected vs actual behavior  
- Inputs, screenshots, or sample data  

---

## Disclosure Rules

- **Do not open public GitHub issues** for safety-critical findings  
- **Do not publicly disclose** vulnerabilities before review and resolution  
- Public issues may be used only for non-safety-critical bugs

---

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure.  
Researchers and users acting in good faith to improve rigging safety will not be penalized for reporting issues through the proper channel.

---

## Response

All reports are reviewed in good faith and prioritized based on potential **rigging safety impact**.
